							Controls
		Left Mouse Click: Selects a control point if clicked near one.
		Mouse Drag: Moves the selected control point, updating the curve dynamically
		Release Mouse Button: Deselects the control point.
						
							How It Works

		The program initializes an OpenGL window with a size of 800×800 pixels.
		It generates four random control points within a normalized coordinate system.
		The Bézier curve is drawn by evaluating the de Casteljau algorithm at different t values (0 to 1).
		Control points appear as small dots, and the curve updates as you move them.
		Simply run the program, click on a control point, and drag it to see the curve change in real time
							
							Two Pairs of points
		Control Points – These define the shape of the curve and can be moved by clicking and dragging them. Adjusting these points changes the curve’s trajectory.
		Curve Points – These are the points generated along the Bézier curve itself.
